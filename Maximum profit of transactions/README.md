Maximum profit of transactionsï¼š

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm and implement it to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie,you must sell the stock before you buy again).
